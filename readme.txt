== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= From where is it getting all the data from? =

Kurve is dependant on WooCommerce. All the data presented in charts and reports are being fetched from WooCommerce tables.

= Will it affect my website's performance? =

Nope. Kurve does not bloat your database with any extra table. Kurve will only use existing tables data to present metrics in more human-readable form.

= I have encountered a bug/issue with Kurve. What do I do? =
